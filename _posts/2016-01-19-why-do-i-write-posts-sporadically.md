It's not like I've nothing to write about. I do have a few things that I could share, good typing skills, loads of free time, still I rarely update my own blog post. I  am trying to depict the reason behind this phenomenon and I think these two reasons dominate over others as for why I scarcely write posts here.

I) I have another blog to write posts on
---------------------------------------

I am also an author at [FossBytes](https://fossbytes.com FossBytes). So, many posts that I could've written here, I've posted them on *fossbytes*. If you're interested in in some Open Source related tips and tools, checkout [FossBytes](https://fossbytes.com FossBytes). Here's a list of some of my most popular posts.

* [How to Use Proxychains to Run Applications Behind Proxy](https://fossbytes.com/how-to-use-proxychains-to-run-applications-behind-proxy)
* [Getting started with Linux](https://fossbytes.com/tag/getting-started-with-linux/)
* [How to use Vi File Manager](https://fossbytes.com/vifm-beginner-tutorial-file-manager-gnu-linux/)

And a few more. Now, writing about tools and tips is fine, but a personal blog should be updated more often. Moreover, I've written nothing on *fossbytes* too for a month or two, so I think I should stop using this as an excuse.

II) I am an AVID procrastinator
------------------------------

I suppose this is bigger reason than previous one. Whenever I learn something (mostly computer related), I think of writing a post about that. Then I get stuck thinking where to post this, aren't there enough tutorials already, or some other thoughts like that. Whenever I've to go through such a thought process, I try to put those tasks in future queue (in my mind) and then forget about them.

I've just read these [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com) posts and they've motivated me enough to even write this meaningless random post. If you're struggling with procrastination too (not only to write blog posts), I really think these posts might help you.

* [Why procrastinators procrastinate](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html)
* [The procrastination matrix](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/procrastination-matrix.html)

I suppose this concludes the post. I'll try to avoid procrastrination and write more about my experiences and other stuff in future too. If you've finished reading this somehow, please checkout this image too: [As an avid procrastrinator this is all i can say](http://9gag.com/gag/aD0eY3N/as-an-avid-procrastinator-this-is-all-i-can-say)

Till next time.
